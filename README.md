## 🚀 Projects :
- [Telemetry Application for EA F1 24 game](https://github.com/Fredrik2002/f1-24-telemetry-application) : This python made project parses binary datas received from the game to create an application giving useful time-live information to the driver. I started this project on F1 22, and kept updating it everytime I needed a new feature
- [Steering wheel replication for EA F1 24 game](https://github.com/Fredrik2002/f1-24-steering-wheel-replication) : Another tool created in Python to help race engineer to follow their drivers during an online race. It simply replicates the steering wheel that the driver sees in-game, with all the informations that comes with it
- [Chess game post-analysis](https://github.com/Fredrik2002/Game-analysis) : The post game analysis tool on chess.com is great, but you have access to it only once a day, so I decided to create my own, which looks like chess.com's one a lot
